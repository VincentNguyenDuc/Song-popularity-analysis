## General information

- Building a predictive model to predict song popularity for 5 popularity levels in the dataset based on features.
- The song popularity column takes the following values: {1,2,3,4,5}, in which the higher the number the more popular the song is. 5 means very popular and 1 means less popular.

## Technologies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Algorithms

- Decision Tree Classification
- Pearson Correlation

## Project Objectives

- Use feature scaling and train a decision tree model.
- Using the test set, predict using the decision tree and compute the confusion matrix and
the accuracy of classification.
- Report the findings from the confusion matrix and accuracy
